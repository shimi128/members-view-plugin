#Extending Umbraco

##[Dashboards](Dashboards/index.md)

A Dashboard is a component for displaying elements on the right-hand side of the backoffice UI area.

##[Sections & Trees](Section-Trees/index.md)

The Umbraco back office consists of sections (sometimes referred to as applications) which contain trees. For example, when you load the back office you'll see that the 'Content' section contains one tree: the content tree whereas the 'Settings' section contains a number of trees: Stylesheets, Content Types, Media Types, etc...

Both sections and trees can be created to extend Umbraco.

##[Property Editors](Property-Editors/index.md)

A property editor is the editor used to insert content into Umbraco. [See here for definition.](../using-umbraco/backoffice-overview/property-editors/index.md)

This section will describe how to work with and create Property Editors.

##[Macro Parameter Editors](Macro-Parameter-Editors/index.md)

A Parameter Editor is the editor used to insert values into a [Macro](../reference/templating/macros/index.md).

This section will describe how to work with and create Parameter Editors.
