# Umbraco Developer Tutorials

## Beginner Umbraco tutorials for developers

This is a set of beginner tutorials for new Umbraco developers. This is NOT official Umbraco documentation.
You can find official documentation at [our.umbraco.org](http://our.umbraco.org).  Also note that since
these tutorials are written by a beginner, they might not necessarily follow best practices.
I welcome any changes to this documentation through the
[github repo](https://github.com/mkimmet/Umbraco-Developer-Tutorials). The tutorials will walk
you through the set up of Umbraco 7 and then create a simple custom form that submits
data into an Umbraco Document Type.  They will also create a simple dashboard to view the
submitted data without logging into the Umbraco admin portal.

*   [Tutorial 1 - How to setup Umbraco 7 with Visual Studio](Tutorial-1-Umbraco7-Setup.md)
*   [Tutorial 2 - Creating a webpage](Tutorial-2-Creating-a-Webpage.md)
*   [Tutorial 3 - Creating and Storing Data in Umbraco](Tutorial-3-Storing-Data-in-Umbraco.md)
*   [Tutorial 4 - Creating a Custom Form in Umbraco](Tutorial-4-Creating-a-Custom-Form.md)
*   [Tutorial 5 - Adding a Member-side "Admin"](Tutorial-5-Adding-a-Member-Side-Admin.md)

At this point I am still working on the tutorials, and I will update this site as each tutorial is finished.
